# flexbox landing page

This is the holy grail landing page, layout done exclusively in CSS (No media queries).

I will use this as practice, and as the start of my custom design-system starter kit (following Kevin Powell's SCSS course).

## Next Steps

1. Create phone and tablet views, using @media queries and starting with mobile first.
   - phone: 30em
   - tablet: 45em
   - desktop: 65em


2. build design-system starter kit
